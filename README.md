# Baby Cup

Baby Cup is a fully autonomous Artificial Emotional Intelligence UI. I created him entirely in HTML/CSS/JavaScript without the use of any image files, frameworks/libraries, or dependencies (except for Webpack and Babel for your convenience). Watching him meander through the pyramid of functions that dictate his random behavior was so entertaining I later integrated Web Speech API speech recognition so we could interrupt his thoughts and tell him about our day, read him the "New York Times" (he usually breaks down crying) or a children's story (he tends to smile and laugh at those). If you feel like being a barista, button and dials on the coffee machine work to make lots of fun caffeinated beverages, so feed Baby Cup his favorite drinks and get to know him. Web Speech API is currently only supported in Chrome. If you're using Chrome say "Baby Cup" to get his attention and "Bye Baby Cup" if you want to stop talking to him.
