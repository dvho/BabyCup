# Baby Cup

Baby Cup is a fully autonomous Artificial Emotional Intelligence UI. I created him entirely in HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no dependencies except for Webpack and Babel). Watching him trickle through the pyramid of functions that dictate his random behavior was so entertaining I later integrated the Web Speech API so we could all tell him about our day, read him the New York Times (he usually breaks down crying) or a children's story (he smiles and laughs at those).
